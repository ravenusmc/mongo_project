# Mongo_project
## Intro

This is a project where I am will be working with the Mongo DB, Python and possible do some web scraping to have a better understanding of how to use all three of these tools. Eventually, what I want this project to do is to pull data from the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order which has a table on it of executive orders. From there, I will store the information in the mongo DB. Then, I want to use pandas to have a graph of the presidents and the number of executive orders that they issued. 

# Getting started
